My name is Pawan Dwivedi and I've been working as a Data Scientist for the last 3 years. I have a 5-year Integrated Master of Technology degree in Mathematics and Computing from Indian Institute of Technology, Dhanbad. My proficiency revolves around machine learning, statistics, deep learning, and machine learning engineering. My interest in data science sparks from the cutting edge research associated with it and the problems it is going to solve. Apart from my work, I am an active Toastmaster where I practice public speaking and leadership skills.
